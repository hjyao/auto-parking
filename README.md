## Some thoughts:
1. I was trying to build it incrementally by doing TDD, ```test/Bus.js``` explained how would it work.

2. I didn't do too much design, as I want to keep it as simple as possible. Actually, I implemented all functions first, and then started doing refactoring.

## Make it run locally:
1. Run ```npm install``` to install local dev dependencies, then use ```npm test``` to run all tests

2. For the output, I put it into an array not console, like ```['1,2,NORTH', '2,3,EAST']``` . That makes the code easier to test.

3. To start exploring the code, ```bus-initializer.js``` might be good entry point.
